This folder contains code for solving the sovereign default model of Arellano (2008) using C++ CUDA.
The CUDA code is compiled as MEX files in MATLAB, allowing the project to leverage MATLAB’s powerful visualization features while harnessing the speed and parallelization benefits of GPU computing.

This folder will soon be updated with additional comments and a detailed summary of the implementation steps.
